                content: "The Airedale Terrier is the largest of all terrier breeds. The breed is tall and sturdy with a muscular body and covered in a thick, course coat of fur.<br>Airedale Terriers are known for their heavy shedding and need a high level of grooming compared to many other breeds. Originating in England in the 1800s, the Airedale Terrier was developed by cross breeding a Terrier with an Otterhound, although it is suspected that there are other breeds in the mix. It is widely believed that the old Black and Tan Terrier, together with the Broken Coated Terrier were probably used.<br>The Airedale Terrier was developed, like most dogs of the time, strictly for the purposes of hunting. Their great strength, paired with their size and agility made them a suitable breed for the hunting of small and medium-sized game such as rats, rabbits and foxes.<br>While the terrier breeds have the reputation for being quite independent and stubborn animals, the Airedale Terrier is very trainable. The breed is very proud and confident but with a consistent reward-based training regime from an early age, the Airedale Terrier will develop into a very obedient companion dog.<br>Airedale Terriers are popular family dogs and have a great reputation for good-natured and gentle play with children. This being said, they are prone to getting easily excited, and can become too rough for smaller kids. They are very intelligent dogs and live to please their owners yet, if there is a distraction, like a bird, rabbit, cat or smaller dog, Airedale Terriers tend to chase rather obey commands.<br>A hunting dog with bounds of energy, the Airedale Terrier requires a good deal of exercise to remain happy and healthy. Good long walks at least once or twice a day are essential, and this will go a long way to curbing any behavioural problems that can develop.<br>Airedale Terriers will generally grow to between 58 and 61cm. The breed should weigh between 23 and 29kgs and will live to age of 10 to 14 years."
